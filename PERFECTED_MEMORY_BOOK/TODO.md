# TODO for Memory Book Updates

## Tasks
- [x] Update index.html: Wrap sorry-note in a modal div and change the text to the new sorry message.
- [x] Update style.css: Reduce .polaroids img max-width to 200px for smaller, visible collage; style the modal as translucent popup.
- [x] Update script.js: Add logic to show the sorry-note modal automatically after the last page loads.

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the book by opening index.html in a browser to ensure collage is smaller and fits well, and modal pops up with translucent sorry note.
